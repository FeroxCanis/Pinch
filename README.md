SwiftUI project, made during online development course.

PS: currently, i'm looking to commence a complex project for my portfolio/resum√© which has many futures like DB, API, linking URLs as well as implementing some nice UI UX layout.
  but first of all, i'll need a simple idea to begin with; im currently thinking on it but if you have any suggestions, leave a comment (*is it called a comment in GitHub? :D).
